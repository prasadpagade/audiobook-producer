put into words the feeling of drowning for years, only to finally—finally—break the surface and breathe? "I need to leave," Vihan said at last, his voice rough. Varun's brows rose. "Leave? We just secured the northern border. The men—" "The men will be fine," Vihan interrupted, rising to his feet. "You'll lead them. You always have." Varun studied him for a long moment, his sharp gaze searching Vihan's face for answers. "Where are you going?" Vihan turned toward the tent's opening, where the first pale light of dawn was beginning to creep over the horizon. "I don't know," he admitted. "But I'll know when I find her." Varun said nothing for a moment. Then, quietly: "Her?" Vihan's jaw tightened, his hands curling into fists at his sides. "Yes," he said simply. And for the first time in three years, Vihan did not feel like a man running from something. He felt like a man finally running toward it.

The air was cool and clean, carrying with it the scent of night-blooming jasmine and the earthy promise of dew-dampened soil. Aaravi had been awake for hours. She sat in the courtyard garden, her legs folded beneath her, her hands moving with practiced efficiency as she ground dried herbs in a worn mortar. The rhythmic scrape of pestle against stone was a meditation in itself, a sound so familiar it had become part of her heartbeat. Valerian root for calming tinctures. Turmeric for inflammation. Neem leaves for wounds that refused to heal. Around her, the temple still slept. The monks would not rise for another hour, and the wounded would not wake until the sun climbed higher, chasing away the last remnants of night. This time—this quiet, sacred space between darkness and day—belonged to her alone. Or it should have. But today, the peace she usually found in these moments eluded her. Her hands moved mechanically, muscle memory guiding her fingers while her mind drifted elsewhere. Somewhere darker. Somewhere she had spent years trying not to go. She could still see his face. Not clearly. Not the way one remembered a loved one or a friend. But in fragments, in flashes—gold eyes reflecting firelight, a jaw tight with pain, shoulders that carried a weight no mortal should bear. The man from her dream. Aaravi's hands stilled. It had been three nights now since the first dream. Three nights of falling asleep in her own bed only to wake in a world of fire and fury, standing in the center of an inferno that should have burned her alive but somehow... didn't. And he was always there. Trapped. Drowning. Fighting against chains she couldn't see but could feel—gods, she could feel them, wrapped around his chest, his throat, his very soul. She had tried to dismiss it at first. Dreams were dreams. The mind played tricks, weaving stories from exhaustion and stress. She had been working too hard, sleeping too little. That was all. But then the second night came. And the third. And each time, the dream grew stronger. More vivid. More real. Last night, she had reached for him. Had stepped through the flames as though they were nothing more than mist, her hand outstretched, her voice calling out even though she didn't know his name. And when she touched him—when her fingers had hovered just over his heart—she had felt it. The bond. Ancient. Undeniable. Woven into the fabric of something far older than memory. Aaravi exhaled slowly, setting the pestle down with trembling hands. "You're distracted." The voice came from behind her, sharp and knowing, cutting through her thoughts like a blade through silk. Aaravi didn't turn. She didn't need to. "Good morning, Mira," she said softly, reaching for a bundle of dried chamomile. Mira stepped into view, her silver hair pulled back in a neat braid, her robes the color of storm clouds. She was older than the temple itself, or so the stories claimed, though Aaravi suspected Mira encouraged such tales simply because she enjoyed being mysterious. Her face was lined with age, but her eyes—sharp and dark and impossibly perceptive—missed nothing. She settled onto the stone bench across from Aaravi with a grace that belied her years, folding her hands in her lap. "You've been grinding that same batch of valerian for the past ten minutes," Mira observed mildly. "Either you're making enough sedative to knock out an elephant, or your mind is elsewhere." Aaravi glanced down at the mortar. Mira was right. The herbs had been reduced to powder so fine it was nearly dust. She set the pestle aside with a sigh. "I didn't sleep well," she admitted. "Clearly." Mira tilted her head, her gaze sharpening. "The same dream?" Aaravi hesitated, then nodded. She had told Mira about the first dream two days ago, half expecting her mentor to dismiss it as exhaustion or an overactive imagination. But Mira had gone very still, her expression unreadable, before asking a single question: Did you see his face? Aaravi had said yes. Mira had said nothing more. Now, the older woman studied her with an intensity that made Aaravi want to squirm. "Tell me," Mira said quietly. "What happened this time?" Aaravi's fingers twisted in her lap, a nervous habit she'd never quite outgrown. "There was a woman," she said slowly, choosing her words carefully. "A lioness. Golden. Beautiful. But... wrong. Twisted." She paused, remembering the way the creature had circled the man, the possessive hunger in her hollow eyes. "She was hurting him. Not with claws or fangs, but with words. With memories." Mira's expression darkened, but she said nothing. "I stepped between them,"
