passed in a blur. Aaravi moved through her duties with mechanical precision—changing bandages, brewing tinctures, tending to the small wounds and ailments of the temple residents. Her hands were steady, her voice calm, her presence a balm to those who sought her care. But inside, her thoughts churned. Find me. The words echoed in her mind, over and over, until they became a drumbeat she couldn't silence. She tried to push them away. Tried to focus on the work in front of her. But the pull was too strong. By the time the sun reached its zenith, Aaravi found herself standing at the edge of the temple's highest terrace, her hands gripping the stone railing, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon. Somewhere out there, he was looking for her. She could feel it. Not in any logical, rational way. But in the same way she could feel a storm approaching before the first clouds appeared. In the same way she could sense a fever breaking before the patient woke. It was instinct. It was fate. And for the first time in her life, Aaravi allowed herself to acknowledge the truth she had been running from. She was tired of being invisible. Tired of giving pieces of herself away until there was nothing left. Tired of being the healer who never allowed herself to be healed. If he came—if this man from her dreams truly existed—then she would answer. Not because fate demanded it. But because she chose it. That night, Aaravi lay in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, her heart pounding in her chest. She didn't know if she would dream again. Didn't know if he would be there, waiting in that world of fire and shadow. But as her eyes drifted closed, as sleep pulled her down into its depths, she whispered the words aloud—a promise, a prayer, a declaration. "I'm here. Find me." And in the space between waking and dreaming, she felt it. A pulse of warmth. A flicker of light. The bond, reaching back. He was coming. End of Chapter Two CHAPTER THREE: THE GHOST OF HER Author: Hannah Kraulik Pagade Publisher: Rohimaya Publishing Series: The Phoenix & Peacock Chronicles Book 1: Eclipse of Fire and Wings CHAPTER 3: THE GHOST OF HER The war tent smelled of leather, smoke, and old maps. Vihan stood at the head of the long wooden table, his hands braced against its scarred surface, his eyes fixed on the carefully drawn lines that marked their territory. Red flags pinned strategic positions. Blue marked water sources. Black indicated enemy movements from the last three months. All of it felt impossibly distant. Around him, his officers spoke in low, clipped tones—discussing supply routes, guard rotations, the fortification of the northern pass. These were men he had fought beside for years, men whose lives he had saved and who had saved his in turn. Their voices blended together into a steady hum of military efficiency, the kind of conversation he could usually navigate in his sleep. But today, every word felt like it was coming from underwater. "—recommend doubling the night watch on the eastern ridge—" "—supplies from the southern outpost should arrive by week's end—" "—reports of bandits near the trade routes, nothing we can't handle—" Vihan heard the words, but they didn't land. His mind was elsewhere. In a dream that felt more real than the waking world. With a woman he had never met but somehow knew. "Vihan." The voice cut through the fog, sharp and familiar. He looked up to find Varun watching him from across the table, his dark eyes narrowed in that particular way that meant he'd noticed something amiss. The others had fallen silent, all eyes now turned toward him, waiting. Vihan straightened, forcing his attention back to the present. "Repeat that," he said, his voice steady despite the chaos in his mind. Ishaan, his third-in-command, exchanged a glance with Varun before clearing his throat. "I was saying, sir, that the scouts reported movement along the western border. It doesn't appear hostile, but—" "Send a patrol," Vihan interrupted. "Twenty men. Report back within two days." Ishaan nodded, making a note. "And the supply situation?" another officer asked. "Manageable," Vihan said curtly. "Ration carefully. We're not expecting conflict, but we prepare as if we are." The meeting continued for another hour, each decision made with the same mechanical precision Vihan had relied on for years. Strategy. Logistics. Discipline. It was what he was good at. What he had been good at. But as the officers filed out of the tent one by one, their tasks assigned and their orders clear, Vihan felt the weight of something shifting inside him. A tectonic movement beneath the surface, slow but inevitable. Varun lingered. He always did. Once the tent was empty save for the two of them, Varun closed the flap and turned, his arms crossed over his chest, his expression unreadable. "Alright," he said. "What's going on?" Vihan didn't look at him. He moved to the small table in the corner where a pitcher of water sat alongside a half-empty bottle of whiskey. He poured himself a cup of water, drained it, and poured another. "Nothing," he said. Varun huffed a quiet laugh, though there was no humor in it. "You've been distracted for three days. You barely speak unless spoken to. You stare at maps like they're written in a language you no longer understand." He paused. "And this morning, I heard you talking in your sleep." Vihan's hand stilled on the pitcher. "What did I say?" "You kept repeating the same thing. Over and over." Varun's voice softened. "Find me." The words hung in the air between them, fragile and impossibly heavy. Vihan set the pitcher down carefully, his jaw tightening. "It was just a dream." "Was it?" Vihan turned to face his oldest friend, the man who had stood beside him through every battle, every loss, every moment of doubt. Varun's expression was
