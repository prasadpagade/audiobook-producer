storm, of water in a hidden spring untouched by human hands. It pulsed once, twice, each beat steady and calm, a heartbeat in opposition to the chaos around him. Vihan's breath caught. The light grew brighter, and from within it, a figure began to take shape. A woman. She moved through the inferno as though it could not touch her, each step deliberate and unhurried. The flames recoiled from her presence, bending and twisting as if in deference. Her form shimmered, not quite solid, not quite ethereal—somewhere in between, as though she existed in a place beyond the boundaries of this nightmare. She was draped in silk that flowed like water, shifting between gold and the deepest blue with every movement. The fabric clung to her form, revealing the gentle curve of her shoulders, the graceful line of her neck. And at her back— Feathers. Iridescent. Shimmering. A cascade of brilliant plumage that fanned outward in a display of impossible beauty. They caught the firelight and reflected it back a hundredfold, each feather glowing with an inner radiance that seemed to hold the very essence of dawn. A peacock. The woman stopped a few paces away, and for the first time in years, Vihan felt the choking grip around his chest loosen. She was... calm. Not in the way of someone untouched by suffering, but in the way of someone who had learned to carry it without being consumed. Her eyes met his. Dark. Deep. Knowing. And gods, the way she looked at him— Not with pity. Not with judgment. But with recognition. As though she saw past the armor, past the scars, past the man he pretended to be, and looked directly at the soul beneath. "You are not who she says you are," the woman said softly, her voice like the first gentle rain after a drought. Vihan's throat tightened. He wanted to speak, to ask who she was, what she was, but the words tangled in his chest, trapped beneath years of silence and shame. The lioness roared, the sound shaking the very foundations of the dreamscape. "You do not belong here!" Sharvani's voice was no longer sweet, no longer seductive. It was raw fury, stripped of pretense. "He is mine!" The woman did not flinch. She did not even turn to acknowledge the lioness. Instead, she took another step forward, her gaze never leaving Vihan's. "You have been carrying her voice for too long," she murmured. "But it is not the only voice you must hear." Sharvani lunged. The lioness moved with terrifying speed, claws extended, fangs bared, every inch of her a weapon honed by rage and obsession. But the woman raised a single hand. Light erupted from her palm, golden and blue, intertwining like twin flames. The air crackled with power—not violent, not destructive, but absolute. The kind of power that did not need to shout to be heard. The lioness collided with the barrier of light and recoiled, snarling, her form flickering like a candle in the wind. "No," Sharvani hissed, her voice breaking, desperate now. "No, you cannot—he is mine—" But her voice was fading, growing distant, as though the dream itself was rejecting her presence. The flames began to die. The smoke thinned. And for the first time in three years, Vihan felt the oppressive weight lift from his chest. The woman lowered her hand, the light dimming but not disappearing entirely. She turned back to Vihan, and this time, there was something softer in her gaze. Something almost... tender. "You are stronger than you know," she said quietly. "But you have forgotten how to see it." Vihan's voice finally found him. "Who are you?" The corner of her lips curved—not quite a smile, but something close. Something that held both sorrow and hope in equal measure. "I think," she said softly, "you already know." She reached up, her fingers hovering just over his chest—not touching, but close enough that he could feel the warmth radiating from her hand. The light pulsed once more, and he felt something deep within him stir. A part of himself he had thought long dead. "Find me," she whispered. The dream shattered. Vihan jolted awake with a gasp, his body drenched in sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs like a war drum. His hand shot to his chest, fingers splaying over the place where her hand had almost touched, expecting—hoping—to find something. A mark. A burn. Anything to prove it had been real. There was nothing. But gods, he could still feel her. Not Sharvani's suffocating presence, but hers. The woman in blue and gold. The peacock. He sat up slowly, dragging a hand through his damp hair, his breath still uneven. The tent around him was dark, the camp outside quiet save for the distant crackle of dying fires and the low murmur of guards on watch. It was just a dream. And yet. He could still smell sandalwood and jasmine, faint and fleeting, as though she had truly been there. "Find me." The words echoed in his mind, not as a command, but as a promise. An invitation. Vihan exhaled slowly, his hands trembling as he pressed them against his knees, grounding himself in the here and now. He had spent three years running from the past. Three years trying to outrun Sharvani's ghost. But this— This was different. For the first time since he had walked away from everything he had known, he did not feel haunted. He felt... called. Across the tent, a low voice broke the silence. "You're awake." Vihan's gaze snapped to the entrance, where Varun stood silhouetted against the faint glow of the campfires outside. His oldest friend, his brother in all but blood, regarded him with a mixture of concern and curiosity. "You were talking in your sleep," Varun said, stepping inside. "Something about finding someone." Vihan did not answer immediately. He couldn't. Because how could he explain what he had just experienced? How could he
