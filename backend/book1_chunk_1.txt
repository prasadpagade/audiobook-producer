CHAPTER ONE: THE DREAM OF FIRE AND FEATHERS Author: Hannah Kraulik Pagade Publisher: Rohimaya Publishing Series: The Phoenix & Peacock Chronicles Book 1: Eclipse of Fire and Wings CHAPTER 1: THE DREAM OF FIRE AND FEATHERS The sky bled crimson and gold, colors too violent to be beautiful, too vivid to be real. Vihan stood at the center of a world that had long since stopped making sense—a battlefield of memory and nightmare woven together so tightly he could no longer tell where one ended and the other began. Smoke coiled around his boots, thick and choking, carrying the acrid stench of burning wood and something far worse. Ash. Bone. The remnants of things that should have been left buried. He had been here before. Every night for the past three years, this place called to him, dragged him down into its depths whether he willed it or not. The dreamscape never changed. The flames always burned in the same pattern. The ruins stretched endlessly in every direction, jagged silhouettes of what had once been towers, temples, homes. And she was always there. Waiting. Vihan's jaw tightened, his hands curling into fists at his sides even though he knew—knew—that this was not real. That his body lay sleeping in his tent miles away, surrounded by his warriors, protected by steel and strategy. But knowledge meant nothing here. Here, in this place between waking and oblivion, she ruled. The laughter came first. Soft, lilting, sweet as poisoned honey. It drifted through the smoke like a caress, wrapping around his throat, his chest, squeezing until his breath came shallow and quick. "Did you miss me, my love?" The voice slithered through the air, neither fully human nor fully beast, but something twisted in between. It dripped with false affection, with the memory of a tenderness that had never truly existed, only mimicked until he'd been foolish enough to believe it real. Vihan did not turn. He would not give her the satisfaction. "You're not real," he said, his voice steady despite the thunder of his pulse. "This is a dream. Nothing more." "Is it?" The flames parted like a curtain drawn aside, and she emerged from the inferno as though born from it. Sharvani. But not as she had been in life—not the woman with dark eyes and a sharper tongue, not the wife who had once stood beside him in victory and whispered promises of empire. No. Here, she was the lioness. Golden fur gleamed like molten metal in the firelight, each strand catching the glow of the flames until she seemed to burn from within. Her body moved with a predator's grace, muscles rippling beneath her pelt, shoulders rolling with each deliberate step. Her eyes—those eyes that had once looked at him with something he'd mistaken for love—were hollow now. Empty. Reflecting nothing but her own insatiable hunger. She circled him slowly, her gaze never leaving his face. "You cannot run from me, Vihan." Her voice was a purr, deceptively gentle. "You never could. Do you know why?" He said nothing. She continued as though he had answered. "Because you are nothing without me." The words were spoken with such certainty, such conviction, that for a moment—just a moment—he almost believed them. "You were a soldier. A warrior with a sword and no purpose. I gave you purpose. I made you the Phoenix." "You broke me," Vihan said quietly, his voice like gravel underfoot. "There's a difference." The lioness laughed, the sound sharp and cruel. "Broke you? No, my love. I forged you. Every battle you won, every enemy you felled, every crown you laid at my feet—that was my work. You were clay, and I shaped you into something magnificent." The heat around him intensified, the flames pressing closer, licking at the edges of his awareness. He could feel the weight of the past bearing down on him, the memories she dredged up with every word. The nights he had knelt before her, seeking approval that never came. The wars he had fought not for honor, but for her ambition. The slow, suffocating realization that the woman he loved had never seen him as a partner, only a weapon to be wielded. "You were mine," Sharvani whispered, leaning closer, her breath hot against his neck. "And you will be again. This... peace you think you've found? This quiet life you're pretending to live?" She laughed, the sound echoing through the ruins. "It's a lie. You are fire, Vihan. And fire does not rest. It consumes." Vihan's breath hitched, his chest tightening. The flames roared higher, the heat unbearable now, and he could feel the dream pulling him deeper, threatening to drown him in the suffocating weight of her presence. "I don't need you," he said, but the words sounded hollow even to his own ears. "Don't you?" The lioness tilted her head, her gaze sharp and knowing. "Then why do I still haunt your dreams?" The question struck deeper than any blade. Because she was right. Three years since he had walked away. Three years since he had severed every tie, burned every bridge, left her standing in the ruins of the empire they had built together. And still, she followed him. Not in flesh. Not in waking. But here. Always here. The flames surged, rising higher, higher, until the world was nothing but heat and smoke and the suffocating weight of her voice— And then, something shifted. The fire wavered. Vihan's eyes snapped open—or perhaps they had always been open; it was impossible to tell in this place—and he felt it. A change in the air. A ripple, like a stone dropped into still water. The flames bent. Not away from him, but toward something else. Something new. The lioness snarled, her ears flattening against her skull, her body tensing. "No." A light bloomed in the distance, cutting through the smoke like a blade through silk. Sapphire blue. Deep and endless, the color of the sky before a
