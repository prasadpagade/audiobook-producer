Aaravi continued, her voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know why. I just... I couldn't stand there and watch. And when I did, the lioness tried to attack me, but—" She broke off, shaking her head. "Light came from my hands. Blue and gold. It drove her back." "And the man?" Mira asked. Aaravi's throat tightened. "He looked at me like..." She trailed off, struggling to find the words. "Like he'd been drowning, and I was air." The silence that followed was heavy, weighted with something Aaravi couldn't name. Finally, Mira spoke, her voice low and grave. "This is not a simple dream, child." Aaravi had known that. Deep down, she had known from the first night. But hearing Mira say it aloud made it real in a way it hadn't been before. "Then what is it?" she asked. Mira rose from the bench, moving to the edge of the garden where the morning light spilled over the stone walls. She was quiet for a long moment, her gaze distant, as though looking at something far beyond the temple grounds. "There are bonds," Mira said at last, "that exist outside the realm of choice. They are written into the fabric of the world itself, woven by forces older than gods or men. Most people live their entire lives without ever encountering such a thing. But for those who do..." She turned back to Aaravi, her expression solemn. "It changes everything." Aaravi's heart hammered in her chest. "You're saying this is real," she whispered. "He's real." "Yes." The single word landed like a stone in still water, sending ripples through everything Aaravi thought she knew. "Where is he?" she asked, her voice barely audible. Mira's lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. "If the dreams are true—and I believe they are—then he is looking for you. And when he finds you, you will have a choice to make." "What choice?" Mira's gaze softened, something almost like pity flickering in her eyes. "Whether to answer the call," she said simply. "Or turn away from it." Before Aaravi could respond, footsteps echoed through the courtyard. She turned to see her father, Ravindra, approaching from the temple's inner sanctum. He was a tall man, his dark hair streaked with silver, his face kind despite the weariness etched into the lines around his eyes. He had been the temple's head healer for nearly thirty years, and in that time, he had saved countless lives. But the work had taken its toll. Aaravi could see it in the way his shoulders slumped, in the careful slowness of his movements. She rose immediately, brushing the herb dust from her hands. "Father," she greeted, concern threading through her voice. "You should be resting. The council meeting isn't until midday." Ravindra waved a dismissive hand, though his smile was warm. "I've rested enough for three lifetimes," he said, settling onto the bench Mira had vacated. "Besides, I wanted to speak with you." Aaravi exchanged a glance with Mira, who merely raised an eyebrow and excused herself with a knowing look. Once they were alone, Ravindra patted the space beside him. Aaravi sat, her hands folding in her lap, waiting. Her father was quiet for a moment, his gaze drifting over the garden—the carefully tended herbs, the flowering vines climbing the temple walls, the small fountain trickling softly in the corner. "You've been working too hard," he said at last. Aaravi opened her mouth to protest, but he held up a hand. "I know you, daughter. You give and give until there is nothing left. You heal everyone who comes through these gates, but you never stop to ask if you, yourself, need healing." The words struck deeper than she expected. "I'm fine," she said quietly, though even she could hear the lie in her voice. Ravindra turned to her, his dark eyes searching her face. "Are you?" Aaravi looked away, her throat tightening. No. She wasn't fine. She hadn't been fine in a long time. But how could she explain that to him? How could she tell her father—who had spent his entire life healing others, who had taught her everything she knew about medicine and compassion—that sometimes, she felt like an empty vessel? That she gave so much of herself to others that she no longer knew what was left? "I had a brother," she said suddenly, the words spilling out before she could stop them. "I don't remember him. I was too young. But I know he existed. I know he died." Ravindra's expression softened, pain flickering across his features. "You were only two years old when he passed," he said gently. "You couldn't have known him." "But Mother did." The name hung between them, heavy and fragile. Rani. Aaravi's mother. A woman who had once been vibrant and full of life, or so the stories claimed. But the woman Aaravi knew was a ghost, a hollow shell who moved through the world but never truly lived in it. She had lost a son, and in losing him, she had lost herself. And in the years that followed, she had never quite found her way back. "She's never looked at me the same way," Aaravi whispered. "I've spent my whole life trying to be enough. To fill the space he left. But I never could." Ravindra's hand covered hers, warm and steady. "You were never meant to fill that space, Aaravi," he said quietly. "You were meant to be yourself. But your mother..." He trailed off, his voice thick with old grief. "She doesn't know how to let go of what she's lost. And in holding on so tightly, she's missed what's right in front of her." Aaravi blinked back the sting of tears. "I don't know how to stop giving," she admitted. "Even when it hurts. Even when I'm empty. I don't know how to just... be." Ravindra squeezed her hand gently. "Then perhaps," he said, "it's time you learned." The rest of the morning
